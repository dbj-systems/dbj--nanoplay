## DBJ*Nanolib roadmap
### In no particular order (for now)

1. #### pool allocator written in C
   - Good examples so far
     - in C
       - seems [simple but workable](https://github.com/jobtalle/pool) 
       - can be used as a key building block
     - [C++, but clean](https://github.com/cacay/MemoryPool) 
        - because it is not "modern" and obfuscated
        - [this fork](https://github.com/billyquith/MemoryPool) has benchmarking added
1. #### tako out `dbj--nanolib/nonstd`  to `dbj_no_std`
