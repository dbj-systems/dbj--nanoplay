### valstat C  interop

| file | comment
| -----|--------
|c_interop.h / c_interop.c | the interop implementation and basic tests declarations.
| c_interop_test.h| testing from C++
| math_valstat.h / math_valstat.c | how log() and log10() could benefit from valstat interop/ basically each and every CRT functions can be "behind" a valstat concept. that would immensely improve the CRT usability.
